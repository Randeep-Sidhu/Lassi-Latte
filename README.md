In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, technology is revolutionizing the way businesses operate, including the food and beverage industry. This project presents the development of a Cafe Website with Order Management System, tailored to provide a seamless and modern dining experience.

The website allows users to browse the cafe's offerings, place orders and make payments either in cash or digitally at the counter, or via Cash on Delivery (COD). Focusing on user-friendly design and responsiveness, the platform ensures an intuitive experience for both mobile and desktop users.

The system facilitates efficient order management for the cafe, ensuring smooth processing of orders and deliveries. Payments are verified manually, with plans to integrate a secure payment gateway in future phases of development.

By incorporating these features, this project aims to enhance the customer experience and streamline cafe operations, making it easier for customers to interact with the cafe digitally.
