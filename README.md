In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, technology is revolutionizing the way businesses operate, 
including the food and beverage industry. This project presents the development of a Cafe 
Website with QR Code Menu & Order Management system, tailored to provide a seamless 
and modern dining experience.  
The website allows users to browse the cafe's offerings, place orders for dine-in or 
takeout, and make payments either in cash or digitally at the counter, or via Cash on Delivery 
(COD). Focusing on user-friendly design and responsiveness, the platform ensures an intuitive 
experience for both mobile and desktop users. The QR code system currently functions as a 
prototype, where a temporary URL (generated via Ngrok) is converted into a QR code for 
accessing the website. In the future, once hosted on a permanent platform like AWS, this 
feature can provide customers with direct access to the digital menu, eliminating the need for 
physical menus. For now, payments are verified manually, with plans to integrate a secure 
payment gateway in future phases of development. 
The system also facilitates efficient order management for the cafe, ensuring smooth 
processing of orders and deliveries. By incorporating these features, this project aims to 
enhance the customer experience and streamline cafe operations, making it easier for 
customers to interact with the cafe digitally.
